# Verilog-Projects

This repository contains Verilog HDL assignments and mini-projects I wrote using **gVim** editor and simulated using **Xilinx ISE (ISim)**.  
Later, I also verified some designs with **Icarus Verilog + GTKWave** on Ubuntu.

Each project folder contains:
- RTL Verilog source files
- Testbench files
- (Optional) Waveform output
